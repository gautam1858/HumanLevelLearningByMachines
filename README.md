# HumanLevelLearningByMachines
People learning new concepts can often generalize successfully from just a single example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require tens or hundreds of examples to perform with similar accuracy. People can also use learned concepts in richer ways than conventional algorithms — for action, imagination, and explanation. A computational model that captures these human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts: handwritten characters from the world ’ s alphabets. The model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian criterion. One-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches.
